# xUnit
TDD by example - xUnit by Kent Beck

This is my apreciation to Kent Beck work in his book TDD by example.

The book allows a deep dive into Test-Driven Development by going through:

• Principles,

• rules,

• technical and social implications,

• TDD cycle,

• and motivations.

------------------------------------------ || -------------------------------------------------- || ------------------------------

At Section II the author implements a tool for test-driven development using python allowing you to:

• Have an introduction to Python

• Write your own testing framework

• See a trickier example of TDD

-------------------------------------- || -------------------------------------------------- || ---------------------------------

The book gives you a clear vision of the methods and classes used to implement the framework but 
from time to time it made me have doubts about my own implementation and I had to seek for help online
founding little to no one.

By going through with the implementation, and after a lot of debugging sessions I managed to have a
functional (love this word) and optimized (love this one even more) version of the framework that I now
share with you in this repo.

I hope that, if you reading the book (wich I strongly recommend) and you are having the same problems I had 
with imports and code formating, this can help you have a clearer vision and know that I'm here for feedbacks.

Best regards,
Tutss.
